To Whom It May Concern:

I'm a software engineer by trait, a problem solver by nature.
I think I can boast a really good employment history leading up to now, having worked in various software engineering environments, getting to know several products and product team setups. 
This broad experience gave me a good general overview on how teams and engineers operate, how organizations are set up, how product is developed.

I seek to be challenged daily, to work with very bright and talented people as to learn and be able to develop my full potential, and feel truly useful.
Some of my relevant personality traits include: logical, disciplined, detail-oriented, questioning status quo, curious.

If you think you would find a position fitting, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Best wishes,
Alex Szabo
