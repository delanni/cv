# Alex Szabó

I'm a full stack programmer, a critical thinker, a quick learner and a problem solver.
I have proven myself valuable in various environments, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve and impress.
I'm strongly inclined towards technically correct, clean and functional code. My engineering drive is mostly in solving tooling/frameworking, architecture and software quality problems.
