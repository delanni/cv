I have a combined 10+ years of experience in working with a wide breadth of languages and technologies from Javascript/Typescript, through R, Java, to Scala and AWS; I have a confident understanding of service architecture and common patterns solutions, infrastructure, ops with AWS and delivery processes. I take end-to-end ownership of my contribution, I stand up for my values and try to improve engineering practises around me.

I'm strongly inclined towards technically correct, clean and functional code. My engineering drive is mostly in solving tooling/frameworking, architecture and software quality problems. I've also vested interest in growing the engineering organization around me through teaching, knowledge sharing and pair programming/debugging.
